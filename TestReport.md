# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: step1: unit A, step 2: unit A+B, step 3: unit A+B+C, etc)> 
    <Some steps may  correspond to unit testing (ex step1 in ex above)>
    <One step will  correspond to API testing, or testing unit route.js>

    | Step | Sequence |
    | ---- | -------- |
    |      |          |
    |      |          |
